# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a book cover application where you can generate new covers, create your own, and view your saved covers in a gallery. This app solves the problem of creating your own cover by offering a randomly generated one. Or if you have input for a specific aspect of the cover, this app helps fill in the rest.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Copy(ctrl + c) and paste(ctrl + v) this link in your browser: https://github.com/baut-jc/pair-romcom
Next, create a directory on your local machine where you want this repo to be saved.
Once inside that directory, copy the SSH code from your browser and type "git clone" followed by the SSH key in your terminal.
Finally, open the repo in your text editor of choice.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had 5 days to work on the project and total we spent between 15-18 hours working on it. We are two weeks into the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project were:
Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
Write code collaboratively
Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

We worked with javascript and HTML in the text editor Visual Code Studio.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
1. We were able to work together well setting aside time daily to meet and go over what we had already completed and what we wanted to accomplish.
2. Our git workflow, we thankfully had no merge conflicts and I think that is in large part to our excellent communication!
3. Creating the buttons and switching views were a breeze.

Challenges:
1. We struggled to link the values of the cover class to the display. We overcame this challenge by manipulating the HTML and inserting the values in the desired elements using interpolation.
2. We struggled to format the saved cover gallery. We overcame this by reaching out to our peers for help by bouncing ideas off of each other.
